Feynman’s Paradox:
Two charged balls are attached to a horizontal ring that can rotate  about a vertical axis without friction.  A solenoid with current I is on the axis.  Initially, everything is at rest.

The current in the solenoid is turned off. What is the direction of the induced $\mathbf{E}$ when viewed from the top?

1. 0
2. CW.
3. CCW.

Note:
* Correct Answer: B

A function, $f(x,t)$, satisfies this PDE:

$$\dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} = \dfrac{1}{c^2}\dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial t^2}$$

*Invent two different functions $f(x,t)$ that solve this equation.  Try to make one of them "boring" and the other "interesting" in some way.*

A "right moving" solution to the wave equation is:

$$ f_R(z,t) = A \cos(kz – \omega t + \delta)$$

Which of these do you prefer for a "left moving" soln?

1. $f_L(z,t) = A \cos(kz + \omega t + \delta)$
2. $f_L(z,t) = A \cos(kz + \omega t - \delta)$
3. $f_L(z,t) = A \cos(-kz – \omega t + \delta)$
4. $f_L(z,t) = A \cos(-kz – \omega t - \delta)$
5. more than one of these!

(Assume $k, \omega, \delta$ are positive quantities)

A "right moving" solution to the wave equation is:

$$ f_R(z,t) = A \cos(kz – \omega t + \delta)$$

How many of these could be a "left moving" soln?

* $f_L(z,t) = A \cos(kz + \omega t + \delta)$
* $f_L(z,t) = A \cos(kz + \omega t - \delta)$
* $f_L(z,t) = A \cos(-kz – \omega t + \delta)$
* $f_L(z,t) = A \cos(-kz – \omega t - \delta)$

Note:
* All of them could be because cos(x) = cos(-x)

1. Yes, always
2. No, never
3. Yes, sometimes depending on $f_1$ and $f_2$

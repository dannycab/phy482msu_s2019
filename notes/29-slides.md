Last class, we found that the wave packet that we constructed from a Gaussian distribution of $k$'s centered around $k_0$ was,

$$f(x) = e^{-x^2/4\sigma} e^{-ik_0x}$$

Sketch this wave packet.

Fourier tells us that we can write a "pulse" by summing up sinusoidal functions:

$f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} a(k)e^{ikx}dk$

If we were to compute $f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} a(k)e^{ik(x-vt)}dk$ where $v$ is a known constant, what would we get?

1. $f(x)$
2. $f(vt)$
3. $f(x-vt)$
4. Something complicated!
5. ???

Note:
* Correct Answer: C

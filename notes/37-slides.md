## Annoucements

* Last Quiz (This Friday)
  * Use special relativity to determine the time between signals
  * Discuss if events are timelike or spacelike separated and how you know
  * Explain why two events could occur at the same place (or time)
* Last Homework
  * Due next Friday NOT Monday! No project problem
* Rest of class
  * Finish up Relativity (next Monday-ish) and discuss E&M in general (next Wednesday-ish)
  * Extra credit assessment (next Friday)

The space time interval is defined by:

1. True
2. False

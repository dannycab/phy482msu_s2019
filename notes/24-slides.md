A light rope (small $m/L$) is fused to a heavy rope (large $m/L$). If I wiggle the **light** rope,

1. most of the wiggles are reflected back; very few wiggles transmit through the heavy rope
2. some of the wiggles are reflected back; some of the wiggles transmit through the heavy rope
3. very few of the wiggles are reflected back; most of the wiggles transmit through the heavy rope
4. ???

Note:
* Correct answer: A

For our reflected and transmitted waves, how many unknowns have we introduced?

$$\mathbf{E}_R = \widetilde{E_R}e^{i(k_Rz-\omega_Rt)}\hat{n}_R$$
$$\mathbf{E}_T = \widetilde{E_T}e^{i(k_Tz-\omega_Tt)}\hat{n}_T$$

1. 2
2. 4
3. 8
4. 12
5. None of the above

Note:
* Correct answer: D
* It's about 12.

An EM wave is normally incident on a boundary between two materials ($n_1 \ll n_2$). If the incident wave starts in **material 1**,

1. most of the wave is reflected back; very little of the wave transmits through material 2
2. some of the wave is reflected back; some of the wave transmits through material 2
3. very little of the wave is reflected back; most of the wave transmits through material 2
4. ???

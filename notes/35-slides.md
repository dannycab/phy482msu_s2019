Consider a $S'$ frame moving with a speed $v$ in 1D with respect to a stationary frame $S$. Using your everyday intuition, write down the relationship between a position measurement $x$ and $x'$.

*Be ready to explain why this makes sense to you.*

The Galilean transformation between $S'$ and $S$ is:

$$x = x' + vt$$

The Lorentz transformation will introduce a $\gamma$, where do you think it goes? And why?

I'm in frame $S$, and you are in is in Frame $S'$, which moves with speed $V$ in the $+x$ direction.

An object moves in the $S'$ frame in the $+x$ direction with speed $v'_x$.
Do I measure its $x$ component of velocity to be $v_x = v'_x$?

1. Yes
2. No
3. ???

Note:
* Correct Answer: B

With Einstein's velocity addition rule,

$$u = \dfrac{u' + v}{1+\frac{u'v}{c^2}}$$

what happens when $v$ is very small compared to $c$?

1. $u\rightarrow 0$
2. $u\rightarrow c$
3. $u\rightarrow \infty$
4. $u \approx u' + v$
5. Something else

* Correct Answer: D

**True or False:** The dot product (in 3 space) is invariant to rotations.

$$\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} \equiv a_{\mu}b^{\mu}$$

1. True
2. False
3. No idea

Note:
* Correct answer: A (when Galilean relativity is ok)

I have seen the Eisntein summation notation before:

$$\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} \equiv a_{\mu}b^{\mu}$$

1. Yes and I'm comfortable with it
2. Yes, but I'm just a little rusty with it
3. Yes, but I don't remember it it all
3. Nope

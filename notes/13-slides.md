AC voltage $V$ and current $I$ vs time $t$ are as shown:

<img src="./images/IV_graphs.png" align="center" style="width: 600px";/>

The graph shows that..

1. $I$ leads $V$  ( $I$ peaks before $V$ peaks )
2. $I$ lags $V$    ( $I$ peaks after $V$ peaks )
3. Neither

Note:
* Correct Answer: B

Suppose you have a circuit driven by a voltage:
$$V(t)=V_0\cos(\omega t)$$

You observe the resulting current is:
$$I(t) = I_0\cos(\omega t-\pi/4)$$

Would you say the current is

1. leading
2. lagging

the voltage by 45 degrees?

Note:
* Correct Answer: B

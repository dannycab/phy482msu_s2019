I'm in frame $S$, and you are in is in Frame $S'$, which moves with speed $V$ in the $+x$ direction.

An object moves in the $S'$ frame in the $+x$ direction with speed $v'_x$.
Do I measure its $x$ component of velocity to be $v_x = v'_x$?

1. Yes
2. No
3. ???

Note:
* Correct Answer: B

With Einstein's velocity addition rule,

$$u = \dfrac{u' + v}{1+\frac{u'v}{c^2}}$$

what happens when $v$ is very small compared to $c$?

1. $u\rightarrow 0$
2. $u\rightarrow c$
3. $u\rightarrow \infty$
4. $u \approx u' + v$
5. Something else

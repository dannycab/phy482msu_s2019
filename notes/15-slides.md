Ampere's Law relates the line integral of B around some closed path, to a current flowing through a surface bounded by the chosen closed path.

$\oint \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{l} =  \mu_0 I$

By calling it a "Law", we expect that:

1. It is neither correct nor useful.
2. It is sometimes correct and sometimes easy to use.
3. It is correct and sometimes easy to use.
4. It is correct and always easy to use.
5. None of the above.

Note:
* Correct Answer: C

The complete differential form of Ampere's Law is now argued to be:

$$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0\mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0\dfrac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$$

The integral form of this equation is:

1. $\iint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{A} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{d}{dt}\oint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{l}$
2. $\oint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{l} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{d}{dt}\oint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{l}$
3. $\iint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{A} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{d}{dt}\iint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{A}$
4. $\oint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{l} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{d}{dt}\iint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{A}$

Consider the surface of an imaginary volume (dashed lines, at right) that partly encloses the left capacitor plate. For this closed surface, is the total flux of the current density, $\iint \mathbf{J} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$ positive, negative or zero?



1. Positive
2. Negative
3. Zero

Note:
* Correct Answer: B
* The charge density is increasing, so the total charge in the region is increasing with time, thus the flux of the current density must be negative (conservation of charge).

1. both zero
2. both negative
3. both positive
4. $\partial \rho/\partial t$ is positive and $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}$ is negative
5. $\partial \rho/\partial t$ is negative and $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}$ is positive

2. They swap signs

Suppose you have a circuit driven by a voltage:
$$V(t)=V_0\cos(\omega t)$$

You observe the resulting current is:
$$I(t) = I_0\cos(\omega t-\pi/4)$$

Would you say the current is

1. leading
2. lagging

the voltage by 45 degrees?

Note:
* Correct Answer: B

Consider an RC circuit attached to a sinusoidally driven voltage source. If at $t=0$ we turn on the source, $I(t=0)=\frac{V_0}{R}$. Then the current follows this solution,

$$I(t) = \dfrac{V_0}{\sqrt{R^2+\frac{1}{\omega^2C^2}}}\cos(\omega t + \phi) - \left(\dfrac{V_0}{R}-\dfrac{V_0\cos\phi}{\sqrt{R^2+\frac{1}{\omega^2C^2}}}\right)e^{-t/RC}$$

What happens to the long term current as $\omega \rightarrow 0$?

1. goes to zero
2. goes to $\dfrac{V_0}{R}$
3. goes to infinity
4. Something else

Note:
* Correct answer: A

Ampere's Law relates the line integral of B around some closed path, to a current flowing through a surface bounded by the chosen closed path.

$\oint \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{l} =  \mu_0 I$

By calling it a "Law", we expect that:

1. It is neither correct nor useful.
2. It is sometimes correct and sometimes easy to use.
3. It is correct and sometimes easy to use.
4. It is correct and always easy to use.
5. None of the above.

Note:
* Correct Answer: C

The complete differential form of Ampere's Law is now argued to be:

$$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0\mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0\dfrac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$$

The integral form of this equation is:

1. $\iint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{A} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{d}{dt}\oint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{l}$
2. $\oint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{l} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{d}{dt}\oint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{l}$
3. $\iint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{A} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{d}{dt}\iint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{A}$
4. $\oint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{l} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{d}{dt}\iint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{A}$

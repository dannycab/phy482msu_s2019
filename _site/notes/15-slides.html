The complete differential form of Ampere's Law is now argued to be:

$$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0\mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0\dfrac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$$

The integral form of this equation is:

1. $\iint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{A} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{d}{dt}\oint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{l}$
2. $\oint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{l} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{d}{dt}\oint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{l}$
3. $\iint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{A} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{d}{dt}\iint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{A}$
4. $\oint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{l} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{d}{dt}\iint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{A}$

Consider the surface of an imaginary volume (dashed lines, at right) that partly encloses the left capacitor plate. For this closed surface, is the total flux of the current density, $\iint \mathbf{J} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$ positive, negative or zero?



1. Positive
2. Negative
3. Zero

Note:
* Correct Answer: B
* The charge density is increasing, so the total charge in the region is increasing with time, thus the flux of the current density must be negative (conservation of charge).

At each location, we will evaluate the sign of $\partial \rho/\partial t$ and $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}$.

**At location 3**, the signs of $\partial \rho/\partial t$ and $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}$ are:
1. both zero
2. both negative
3. both positive
4. $\partial \rho/\partial t$ is positive and $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}$ is negative
5. $\partial \rho/\partial t$ is negative and $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}$ is positive

Note:
* Correct Answer: D
* One way to think about this is that the charge on the plate is increasing (so the density is increasingly more positive - positive charge). So the divergence of the current density is negative (jives with previous CQ also).

Suppose the original Ampere's law $\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0\mathbf{J}$ were correct without any correction from Maxwell (it’s not, but suppose for a moment that it is). What would this imply about $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}$ at points 2 and 4 in the diagram?

1. The remain unchanged
2. They swap signs
3. They become zero
4. ???

Let's continue with the (incomplete) definition of Ampere's Law: $\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0\mathbf{J}$.

What does this form tell you about the signs of $(\nabla \times \mathbf{B})_x$ at locations 1, 3, and 5?

1. All positive
2. All negative
3. Positive at 1 and 5, zero at 3
4. Negative at 1 and 5, zero at 3
5. Something else


Note:
* Correct Answer: C
* All we need here is the direction of Jx, which is zero at 3

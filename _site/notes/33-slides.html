Two major results of special relativity are Time Dilation and Lorentz Contraction. Please pick one of the choices below which best describes how well you feel you understand them.

1. No idea what these effects are
2. I remember having heard about these, but couldn't define them precisely right now.
3. I know what these effects are, (but I've forgotten how to derive them)
4. I know what these effects are, and I even sort of remember the derivation, but it would take me a while to sort it out
5. I'm confident I could derive these results right now

Standing on a moving walkway in the airport that is moving at 1 m/s to the right, you toss a ball into the air. You observe the ball moving straight up and down.

I'm sitting on a bench watching your shenanigans. What do I have to do to make my physics match yours? That is, what do I have to do to reproduce all your measurements?

1. Add 1 m/s to the left
2. Add 1 m/s to the right
3. Subtract 1 m/s to the right
4. Subtract 1 m/s to the left
5. None or more than one of these

Note:
* Correct Answer: E (it's A and C)

A light bulb flashes in the center of a train car that is moving at speed v with respect to the ground.  In the frame of reference of the train car, light wave from the flash strikes the front and back of the train simultaneously.

In the frame of reference of the ground, the light strikes the back of the train **(fill in the blank)** the light strikes the front of the train.

1. before
2. after
3. at the same time as

Two firecrackers explode. Lucy, halfway between the firecrackers, sees them explode at the same time. Ricky (same reference frame as Lucy) is next to firecracker 2. According to Ricky, which firecracker explodes first?

1. Both explode at the same time
2. Firecracker 1 explodes first
3. Firecracker 2 explodes first

*Hint: Separate what Ricky "sees" from what he would observe.*

Note:
* Correct Answer: A

In particle decay the rate of decay is proportional to the number of particles left,

$$\dfrac{dN}{dt} = -\lambda N$$

If we start with $N_0$ particles, what's the fraction of remaning particles in a time $\Delta t$?

1. $N_0 e^{-\lambda \Delta t}$
2. $N_0 e^{+\lambda \Delta t}$
3. $N_0 e^{-\Delta t/\lambda}$
4. $N_0 e^{+\Delta t/\lambda}$
5. Something else

Note:
* Correct answer: E
* It's a fraction, so it's A without the number

In a particle detection experiment, the fraction of particles detected is:

1. underestimated
2. overestimated
3. the same as

if we use the time of flight in the detector frame.

In our particle detection experiment, the fraction of particles detected at a given location in detector frame will be:

$$e^{-\lambda \Delta t}$$

What is $\Delta t$ in this case?

1. The time to traverse from the source to the detector
2. The time observed on the clock on the wall
3. The time observed by the particles in their frame
4. None of these
5. More than one of these

Note:
* Correct answer: E? Definitely C, but could be A

Is the time interval ($\Delta t$) between two events Lorentz invariant?

1. Yes
2. No

Is the proper time interval ($\Delta \tau = \dfrac{\Delta t}{\gamma}$) between two events Lorentz invariant?

1. Yes
2. No

<section data-markdown="">

Consider a $S'$ frame moving with a speed $v$ in 1D with respect to a stationary frame $S$. Using your everyday intuition, write down the relationship between a position measurement $x$ and $x'$.

*Be ready to explain why this makes sense to you.*

</section>

<section data-markdown="">

The Galilean transformation between $S'$ and $S$ is:

$$x = x' + vt$$

The Lorentz transformation will introduce a $\gamma$, where do you think it goes? And why?

The space time interval is defined by:

$$I\equiv x^2 + c^2t^2$$

Events with common space time intervals lie on a hyperbole of constant $I$.

**True or False:** A Lorentz boost (change of to another inertial frame) can allow you to shift between different hyperboles.

1. True
2. False

Note:
* Correct answer: B

Do you see a problem do you see with $\mathbf{F} = \dfrac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt}$ with regard to relativity? We still define $\mathbf{p} \equiv \gamma m\mathbf{v}$.

1. There's no problem at all
2. Yup there's a problem, and I know what it is.
3. There's probably a problem, but I don't know what it is.

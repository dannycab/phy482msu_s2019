Inside this resistor setup, (real world, finite sizes!) What does the E field look like inside ?

1. Must be uniform and horizontal
2. Must have some nonuniformity, due to fringing effects!

Inside this resistor setup, what can you conclude about the current density $\mathbf{J}$ near the side walls (in steady state)?

<img src="./images/shaped_resistor.png" align="center" style="width: 600px";/>


1. Must be exactly parallel to the wall
2. Must be exactly perpendicular to the wall
3. Could have a mix of parallel and perp components
4. No obvious way to decide!?

Note:
* Correct Answer: A (otherwise current leaks out or there's accumulation!)

**Activity:** Consider two spheres (radii $a$ and $b$ with $b$>$a$) that are constructed so that the larger one surrounds the smaller one. Between them is a material with conductivity $\sigma$. A potential difference of $V$ is maintained between them with the inner sphere at higher potential.

* What is the current $I$ flowing between the spheres in terms of the known variables?
* How does your result relate to Ohm's Law?

Hint: Assume a uniform charge $+Q$ distributed over the inner sphere and use Gauss' Law to find $\mathbf{E}$.

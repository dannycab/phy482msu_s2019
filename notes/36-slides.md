The displacement between two events $\Delta x^{\mu}$ is a contravariant 4-vector.

Is $\Delta x^{\mu}/\Delta \tau$ also a 4-vector (where $\Delta \tau$ is the proper time)?

2. No

Note:

3. $a \cdot b = a_{\nu}b^{\nu}$
4. None of these
5. All three are correct

Velocity is a defined quantity:

$$\mathbf{u}=\dfrac{\Delta\mathbf{r}}{\Delta t} = \langle \dfrac{\Delta x}{\Delta t},\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta t},\dfrac{\Delta z}{\Delta t}\rangle$$

In another inertial frame, seen to be moving to the right, parallel to x, observers see:

$$\mathbf{u'}=\dfrac{\Delta\mathbf{r'}}{\Delta t'} = \langle \dfrac{\Delta x'}{\Delta t'},\dfrac{\Delta y'}{\Delta t'},\dfrac{\Delta z'}{\Delta t'}\rangle$$

Is velocity a 4-vector?
1. Yes
2. No

Note:
* Correct answer: B

In my frame ($S$) I measure two events which occur at the same place, but different times $t_1$ and $t_2$ (they are NOT simultaneous)

Might you (in frame $S'$) measure those SAME two events to occur simultaneously in your frame?

1. Possibly, if heâ€™s in the right frame!
2. Not a chance
3. Definitely need more info!
4. ???

Note:
* Correct Answer: B

1. Greater than 1
2. Equal to 1
3. Less than 1

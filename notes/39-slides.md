Do you see a problem do you see with $\mathbf{F} = \dfrac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt}$ with regard to relativity? We still define $\mathbf{p} \equiv \gamma m\mathbf{v}$.

1. There's no problem at all
2. Yup there's a problem, and I know what it is.
3. There's probably a problem, but I don't know what it is.

Can we define a 4-force via the 4-momentum?

$$\dfrac{dp^{\mu}}{dt} = K^{\mu}$$

Is $K^{\mu}$, so defined, a 4-vector?

1. Yes, and I can say why.
2. No, and I can say why.
3. None of the above.

Note:
* Correct Answer: A

To match the behavior of non-relativistic classical mechanics, we might tentatively assign which of the following values to $\mathbf{K} = K^{1,2,3}$:

1. $\mathbf{K} = \mathbf{F}$
2. $\mathbf{K} = \mathbf{F}/\gamma$
3. $\mathbf{K} = \gamma\mathbf{F}$
4. Something else

Note:
* Correct Answer: C

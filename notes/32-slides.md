**True or False:** EM Waves can have velocities higher than $c$.

1. True
2. False
3. I don't know what to believe anymore

Note:
* Correct answer: A

Fourier tells us that we can write a "pulse" by summing up sinusoidal functions:

$f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} a(k)e^{ikx}dk$

If we were to compute $f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} a(k)e^{ik(x-vt)}dk$ where $v$ is a known constant, what would we get?

1. $f(x)$
2. $f(vt)$
3. $f(x-vt)$
4. Something complicated!
5. ???

Note:
* Correct Answer: C

Two major results of special relativity are Time Dilation and Lorentz Contraction. Please pick one of the choices below which best describes how well you feel you understand them.

1. No idea what these effects are
2. I remember having heard about these, but couldn't define them precisely right now.
3. I know what these effects are, (but I've forgotten how to derive them)
4. I know what these effects are, and I even sort of remember the derivation, but it would take me a while to sort it out
5. I'm confident I could derive these results right now

<section data-markdown>

Standing on a moving walkway in the airport that is moving at 1 m/s to the right, you toss a ball into the air. You observe the ball moving straight up and down.

I'm sitting on a bench watching your shenanigans. What do I have to do to make my physics match yours? That is, what do I have to do to reproduce all your measurements?

1. Add 1 m/s to the left
2. Add 1 m/s to the right
3. Subtract 1 m/s to the right
4. Subtract 1 m/s to the left
5. None or more than one of these

Note:
* Correct Answer: E (it's A and C)

A light bulb flashes in the center of a train car that is moving at speed v with respect to the ground.  In the frame of reference of the train car, light wave from the flash strikes the front and back of the train simultaneously.

In the frame of reference of the ground, the light strikes the back of the train **(fill in the blank)** the light strikes the front of the train.

1. before
2. after
3. at the same time as

In particle decay the rate of decay is proportional to the number of particles left,

$$\dfrac{dN}{dt} = -\lambda N$$

If we start with $N_0$ particles, what's the fraction of remaning particles in a time $\Delta t$?

1. $N_0 e^{-\lambda \Delta t}$
2. $N_0 e^{+\lambda \Delta t}$
3. $N_0 e^{-\Delta t/\lambda}$
4. $N_0 e^{+\Delta t/\lambda}$
5. Something else

Note:
* Correct answer: E
* It's a fraction, so it's A without the number

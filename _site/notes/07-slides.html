In our basic model of a battery, we said that the force per unit charge the battery provides through chemical reactions ($\mathbf{f}$) had a magnitude equal the electric field produced by the separated charge ($\mathbf{E}$). This maintains a constant drift speed across the battery for the electrons.

If the battery has some internal resistance ($r$), which is larger?
1. $|\mathbf{f}|$
2. $|\mathbf{E}|$
3. Both still the same

Note:
Correct answer: A

The current in an infinite solenoid of radius $R$ with uniform magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ inside is increasing so that the magnitude $B$ in increasing with time as $B=B_0+kt$.  If I calculate $V$ along path 1 and path 2 between points A and B, do I get the same answer?

&lt;img src="./images/V_outside_solenoid.png" align="left" style="width: 500px";/&gt;


1. Yes
2. No
3. Need more information

Note:
* Correct Answer: B
</section>

<section data-markdown="">

Faraday found that EMF is proportional to the negative time rate of change of B. EMF is also the line integral of a **force/charge**. The force is $\mathbf{f}_q$ in the expression:

$$\mathcal{E} = \oint \mathbf{f}_q \cdot d\mathbf{l}$$

That force is:

1. the magnetic Lorentz force.
2. an electric force.
3. the strong nuclear force.
4. the gravitational force.
5. an entirely new force.

Note:
* Correct Answer: B, but there's a subtlety here; could E (special relativity)
